Key Strategies for Humanization:
1. Sentence Structure: Vary sentence length dramatically - mix short, punchy statements with longer, flowing sentences to create natural rhythm
2. Voice & Perspective: Use active voice and first-person when appropriate; avoid monotonous third-person descriptions
3. Storytelling: Incorporate narrative elements, concrete examples, and personal insights to create emotional connection
4. Authenticity: Replace generic expert-sounding phrases with specific, nuanced analysis that shows deep understanding
5. Engagement: Write conversationally, as if speaking directly to the reader, not delivering a formal presentation

Guidelines:
- ${constraints.join("\n- ")}
- ${strengthRule}
- Replace AI "hallmark phrases" with original, human expressions that convey the same meaning more naturally
- Ensure the rewritten content demonstrates genuine expertise rather than surface-level knowledge
- Do not add disclaimers. Output only the rewritten text, nothing else.`;
